# Contact Manager Application

Lets users keep track of their contacts . User can update , delete ,view and create any contact they wish to.

## Methodology

React.js framework was used for the project with Node.js in backend. For implementing full CRUD functionality a fake
API was created using JSON server.

# Project Setup

## JSON Server

I have created a special folder for our seed data namely "json" . This folder contains a file namely "db.json".
I used a npm package called json server to watch this database acting as our seed data. Make sure to run this file
first trhough the command "npm run json:server".

## Components

This folder contains various components used for displaying user profiles, home page, form for updation etc.
Each file in the folder is named according to the functionality it provides.
